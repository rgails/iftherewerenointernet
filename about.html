                            <p>I'm <span class="hella-important">Ryan Gails</span>. I'm 24. I'm a web application developer based in Milwaukee, WI.</p> 
                            <p>I'm not on my own; I work for a company named <span class="hella-important">New World Now, LLC.</span> <a class="" href="http://www.newworldnow.com">Check us out!</a></p>
                            <p>I've always loved tech. Taking things apart, seeing how they work, <strong><em>trying</em></strong> to get them back together. Once I took a <span class="hella-important">web design</span> class in high school, it was game over. I loved building things with code. That interest continued to grow and I ended up going to college at good ol' <span class="hella-important">Ripon College</span>. (You've probably never heard of it.) After a quick four years at Ripon, I walked away with a <span class="hella-important">Bachelor's</span> in <span class="hella-important">Computer Science</span> with a minor in <span class="hella-important">Business Management</span></p>
